The Weather App is a web-based application that allows users to get real-time weather updates for any city in the world. By entering a city name, users can quickly access current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy). The app fetches live data from the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it in a clean and user-friendly interface.
